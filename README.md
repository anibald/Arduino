Arduino Projects

This repository is intended to be a place where I share my projects.
On this moment I'm interested in developing remote sensing prototypes using the SIM900 GSM chip.

Feel free to download and contribute

PS. Code comments are written in portuguese, sorry, but at this point I'm coding very basic things, so I think it won't be a problem to understand what's going on.
